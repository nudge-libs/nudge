## What is Nudge?

Nudge is a TypeScript library for building AI prompts. You define *what* your prompt should do with a fluent builder-Nudge uses AI to generate the actual system prompt.

```ts
import { prompt } from "@nudge/core";

const reviewer = prompt("code-reviewer", (p) =>
  p
    .persona("senior engineer")
    .input("code snippet")
    .output("review with suggestions")
    .do("explain reasoning")
    .dont("nitpick style")
);
```

Run `npx @nudge/cli generate` → get an optimized system prompt. It's cached, so unchanged definitions skip the AI call.

## Why use it?

- **Type-safe** - Full autocomplete. Typed variables and options.
- **AI-generated** - Your structure becomes a polished prompt. No hand-tuning.
- **Cached** - Hash-based caching. Only regenerate what changed.
- **Composable** - Share rules with `.use()`. Toggle sections with `.optional()`.

## Example

```ts
const assistant = prompt("assistant", (p) =>
  p
    .persona("assistant for {{company}}")
    .do("be concise")
    .optional("formal", (p) => p.do("use formal language"))
);

// Variables and options are fully typed
assistant.toString({ company: "Acme", formal: true });
```
