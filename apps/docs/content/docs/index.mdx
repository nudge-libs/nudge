## What is Nudge?

Stop hand-crafting system prompts. Define what you want with a builder, let AI write the actual prompt.

```ts
import { prompt } from "@nudge/core";

const reviewer = prompt("code-reviewer", (p) =>
  p
    .persona("senior engineer")
    .input("code snippet")
    .output("review with suggestions")
    .do("explain your reasoning")
    .dont("nitpick style")
);
```

Run `npx @nudge/cli` and get an optimized system prompt—cached so it only regenerates when you change the definition.

## Why Nudge?

**Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support. Autocomplete for methods, typed variables, typed optional blocks.

**AI-powered** — Your structured definition becomes a well-crafted system prompt. No more prompt engineering by hand.

**Cached** — Prompts are hashed. Unchanged prompts skip the AI call entirely.

**Composable** — Share common rules with `.use()`. Toggle sections at runtime with `.optional()`.

## Quick Example

```ts
// Define once
const assistant = prompt("assistant", (p) =>
  p
    .persona("helpful assistant for {{company}}")
    .do("be concise")
    .optional("formal", (p) => p.do("use formal language"))
);

// Use with variables and options
assistant.toString({ company: "Acme", formal: true });
```
