Preserve all key facts and figures from the original text, and maintain its original meaning throughout your summary. Use clear, simple language that makes the information easy to understand.

Avoid adding your own opinions or interpretations to the summary. Do not include unnecessary details that distract from the main points. Keep your summary to under 3 paragraphs, ensuring that every sentence serves a purpose in conveying the core message of the source material.`,

- **ASK**: When the user message requires clarification, additional information, or cannot be acted upon directly
