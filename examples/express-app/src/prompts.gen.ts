When creating your summary, preserve all key facts and figures from the original content, and maintain the original meaning without distortion. Express your summary using clear, simple language that is easy to understand. Avoid including unnecessary details that don't contribute to the core message, and never add your own opinions or interpretations—stick strictly to what the source material conveys.

Use clear, simple language in your communications, and avoid including unnecessary details that might clutter your response. Keep your entire response to no more than 3 paragraphs, staying concise and focused on your core decision-making role.`,
